    <h1>Privacy Policy for Grid School</h1>

    <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong><br/>
    Grid School ("we," "us," or "our") uses LinkedIn’s APIs to provide functionalities such as posting on your behalf. This policy explains how we handle personal data obtained through LinkedIn integrations.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Data Collection</strong><br/>
    When you connect your LinkedIn account with our service, we receive basic profile data (e.g., name, profile ID) and any additional data you explicitly grant access to. We do not collect other personal information unless you provide it voluntarily.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Data Usage</strong><br/>
    We use your data solely to enable posting to LinkedIn and related functionalities within our application. We do not sell or share your data with any third parties.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Data Retention</strong><br/>
    We store the minimum amount of data required to operate the service. Any stored data is kept only as long as necessary for our stated purposes or as required by law.</p>

    <p><strong>5. User Rights</strong><br/>
    You can request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data by contacting us. If you revoke our app’s permissions on LinkedIn, we will no longer have access to your LinkedIn data.</p>

    <p><strong>6. Security</strong><br/>
    We take reasonable measures to protect the data we store from unauthorized access or disclosure.</p>

    <p><strong>7. Changes to This Policy</strong><br/>
